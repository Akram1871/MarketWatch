# MarketWatch
 
# The problem: 
The Ministry of Commerce of Bangladesh has been supplying products 
through TCB to ensure the necessary supply, including the import, supply and exploration 
of these products, to keep the prices of essential commodities in the public purchasing 
capacity. But lately, the prices of essential commodities, including onions, are 
unaffordable, and it is imperative to take initiative to adopt a timely solution or action plan. 
In coordination with The platform will include real-time information including importer's 
overall information, quantity and price of imported goods, sourcing, cost.


# The Need: 
Controlling market fluctuations is necessary in todayâ€™s corrupt market for that 
we need to coordinate with various government agencies by utilizing digital technology, 
the supply chain ensures human income by aligning with the international price of the 
product, allowing proper production of all essential commodities, finding suitable product 
sources, collecting information on tariff and transportation costs and ensuring quality 
products to create a necessary Integrated Market Intelligence Platform.

The existing system is neither cost effective nor time-efficient because people will have 
to meet for every reason whether they want to collect or update information. If they want 
to take any initiative to control the market price fluctuation time also be wasted. Thus the 
existing system is inconvenient. So, the following system divide workers into different part 
for controlling market price fluctuation easily.

The main components of the proposed system are
1. Registration
2. Login
3. Detailed info about different product (price, demand, supply ,amount of store 
product, source of import product, cost for import product,local and international 
price of product)
4. Location based search
5. Team leaders can update info
6. Members can communicate with each other by this system
